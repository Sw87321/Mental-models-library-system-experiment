This repository contains all experimental materials used in our study on measuring developers’ mental models of a library software system.

## Contents
- `code/` – LibSys source code (Java) with three injected defects and one missing feature
- `materials/concepts-list.txt` – The 25 core concepts used for pairwise similarity ratings
- `materials/task-instructions.md` – Instructions given to participants
- `materials/similarity-rating-template.csv` – Blank template for similarity ratings
- `materials/interview-guide.md` – Semi-structured interview questions
- `materials/defects-description.md` – Detailed description of the three injected defects (for replication/grading only)

The study design, results, and analysis are described in the submitted final report.
