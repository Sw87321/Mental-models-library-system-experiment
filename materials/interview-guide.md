# Retrospective Interview Guide (10 minutes)

Thank you for completing the task. We now have a few open questions:

1. When working on the system, what assumptions did you make about how data flows between User, Loan, Book, and Fine?
2. Did you rely on any unspoken rules or past experience when calculating or applying fines?
3. Were there any situations where you mentally anticipated errors (e.g., null values, concurrent access) before checking the code?
4. Was there anything about the system’s behavior that surprised you or didn’t match your initial expectations?
5. Any other thoughts about how you understood the system?
