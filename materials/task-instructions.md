# Participant Task Instructions

You are participating in a study on program comprehension.

## Phase 1 (20–25 minutes)
You will see a list of 25 core concepts from the LibSys library system.  
Rate the similarity of every pair on a scale from 1 (completely different) to 5 (identical).  
Use the provided Excel/CSV template.

## Phase 2 (40 minutes)
You have access to the full source code of LibSys (a Java library management system).

Your task:
- Locate and fix the three bugs that currently exist in the system.
- Implement the missing feature: automatic overdue fine escalation (if a loan is overdue >30 days, double the daily fine).

You may run the system and its tests. Do not change the overall architecture unless absolutely necessary.

Thank you for your participation!
